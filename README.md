**HIV-Target-Identification**


The primary goal of this project is to identify potential therapeutic targets for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) by analyzing host-pathogen interactions. By pinpointing crucial host genes and proteins involved in HIV replication and pathogenesis, the project aims to facilitate the development of novel treatment strategies.

**Methodology:**

The project employs a combination of bioinformatics and computational biology approaches:

1. Data Collection: Gathering gene expression datasets from HIV-infected and uninfected samples.

2. Data Preprocessing: Normalizing and cleaning the data to ensure accuracy.

3. Differential Expression Analysis: Identifying genes that are significantly upregulated or downregulated in response to HIV infection.

4. Network Analysis: Constructing protein-protein interaction networks to determine key hubs and bottlenecks.

5. Functional Enrichment: Performing Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses to understand the biological processes and pathways affected.

6. Target Prioritization: Ranking potential targets based on their centrality in networks and involvement in critical pathways.

   

**Key Findings:**

1. Identification of several host genes that play pivotal roles in HIV replication.

2. Discovery of novel interactions between HIV proteins and host cellular machinery.

3. Highlighting of specific pathways, such as immune response and cell cycle regulation, that are significantly altered during infection.

**Implications:**

The insights gained from this project can inform the development of host-targeted therapies, which may offer advantages over traditional antiretroviral treatments by reducing the likelihood of resistance development.

**Conclusion:**

By integrating multi-omics data and advanced computational analyses, the HIV Target Identification project provides a comprehensive understanding of the host factors involved in HIV infection, paving the way for innovative therapeutic interventions.
